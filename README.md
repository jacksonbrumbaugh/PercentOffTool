# PercentOffTool
A PowerShell tool to quickly calculate what value is X% off from the input value

The default percentage off is 10%

This setting can be updated by running the Set-PercentOff command

# First
Down the module to your desired location

# Second
Import the module into a PowerShell session

# Third
Once you have the PercentOff parameter set as desired,
Run "Start-PercentOffTool"
& follow the menu prompts

As an example
if one inputs a value of 3.5
then the "To" would display as 3.15
since the default 10% off from 3.5 is 3.15
