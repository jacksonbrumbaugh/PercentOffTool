# PercentOffTool
A PowerShell tool to quickly calculate what value is X% off from the input value

The default percentage off is 10%

This setting can be updated by running the Set-PercentOff command

# First
Download the module to your desired location

# Second
Import the module into a PowerShell session

# Third
Once you have the PercentOff parameter set as desired

Run "Start-PercentOffTool"

& follow the menu prompts

# Example
If one inputs a value of 3.50

Then the "To" would display as 2.8

Since the default 20% off from 3.50 is 2.80
